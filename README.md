Super-Efficient Cross-Correlation (SEC-C): a fast matched filtering code for seismic waveforms, optimized for use on desktop computers

SEC-C is an ongoing effort for accelerating the speed of cross-correlation analysis for seismological applications. We have a manuscript in the review. If you are using SEC-C for your work/research please cite the following paper:

Nader Shakibay Senobari, Gareth Funning,  Eamonn Keogh, Yan Zhu, Zachary Zimmerman,  Chin-Chia M. Yeh,  and Abdullah Mueen, "Super-Efficient Cross-Correlation (SEC-C): a fast matched filtering code for seismic waveforms, optimized for use on desktop computers," Submitted to SRL, 2018.

SEC-C is written in MATLAB but a python version is also provided. The current python version is slower than MATLAB version but the work is in progress. 

SEC-C has two main branches: SEC-C for continues data (i.e. template matching or matched filtering) and SEC-C for individual waveforms (i.e. pairwise cross-correlation). Former is already uloaded and the latter will be uploaded in near future.
